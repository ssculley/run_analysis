# run_analysis
This is the final project from Getting and Cleaning Data class from Coursera. This run_analysis.R script will pull data and clean up the data then finally produce a tidy data set.   

There are five sections to this R script and purpose for each section is shown below:

1) Setting the proper working directory and read in data sets that were given
2) Merging all different data sets from step 1 into one data set
3) Extracting only data that are needed for this project from the one data set created from step 2, which are mean and standard deviation data
4) Inserting appropriate names for activity and subject data that were produced in Step 3
5) Creating a tidy dataset from the dataset created in Step 4, and write the result to a text file

After the script is finished, it will produce a final resulting text file called "AVGTidyData"
