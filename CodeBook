  The raw data set that we are working with were collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone 
and it contains values from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals while proforming different activities 
from selected subjects. 

  run_analysis.R is R script that combines all the raw data sets into one, and pulls only mean and standard deviation 
data for final tidy data set generation.

Code Book: Dimension and measurement variables that used in this script are listed below:

Subject: selected individual 
Activity types: assigned value ranging from 1 to 6
  Walking (1): test subject was walking
  Walking Upstairs (2): test subject was walking towards upstairs
  Walking Downstairs (3): test subject was walking towards downstairs
  Sitting (4): test subject was sitting
  Standing (5): test subject was standing
  Laying (6): test subject was laying down
